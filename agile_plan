We chose to use the Agile development method over the standard waterfall
method.
• This will allow us to be more flexible and to change ideas when we see fit
due to the change in our scope or ever evolving understanding of concepts.
• We all work as a unit which fosters better team collaboration and communication than if each team member was just assigned a task and they
report back when they’re simply done with their task. This communication and collaboration is brought about by daily stand ups and sprint
reviews and planning where each member of the team will have to giver
their input on the matter.
• We are able to demonstrate our ideas early on. Instead of waiting for
the entire program to be developed. Through developed features, we can
show some proof of concept as to what we want to develop and how it
should function. That will also play a role in boosting the teams confidence/morale during the development of the platform/program.
• We are able to catch mistakes early on and make the appropriate changes
to rectify those mistakes instead of doing it at this last minute.
